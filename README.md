# âœ¨ Personal Scripts
These a python and shell scripts I use on my computer to automate daily tasks like:
- Creating markdown files for task management (to-do lists, eisenhower matrix)
- Cleaning up misc files on my desktop
- *(TODO)* Summarize and auto-prioritize tasks and dump to a MD file for a daily to-do list
- *(TODO)* Auto backup desktop media & archived repos to FTP
- *(TODO)* Aggregate Solana wallet balances via a custom CLI tool
& more to be added!
